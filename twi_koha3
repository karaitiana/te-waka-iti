# application

This policy applies to all members and staff of the Te Waka Iti community.

# purpose

The purpose of this policy is to set out the principles and processes that apply to: a. the gifting of koha and donations by the Trust b. sponsorship by the Trust.

# definitions

In this policy

**donation** means an unconditional gift as defined by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) as follows: _"An unconditional gift is defined as a donation made to a non-profit body, where the giver (or any relative) does not receive any goods or services in return for the donation. This carries with it no obligations to account for tax."*_

**koha** is a form of, and means the same as, 'donation'

**sponsorship** means support of an event, activity, person, or organisation financially or through the provision of products or services.

# principles

The Trust recognises that a donation or koha to a third party may be appropriate in circumstances where: a. there is a clearly identified relationship between the Trust and the recipient of the donation or koha, and b. it can be clearly demonstrated that the donation or koha complies with this policy and either:

1. is justified in cultural terms, or
2. is justified in terms of its alignment with the Trust's Vision and strategic goals.

Personal relationships and obligations of Trust staff members as private individuals do not of themselves constitute relationships or obligations on behalf of the Trust in the terms stipulated in section 4a of this policy.

The Trust recognises that sponsorship of an event, activity, person or organisation may be appropriate where such sponsorship aligns with the Trust's vision, strategic objectives, brand and role as a charitable trust.

# advice

Any queries about donations, koha or sponsorship should be directed to the relevant {appropriate role here}.

# payments which are not donations or koha

The following types of payment cannot be treated as donations or koha because they have taxation obligations:

a. a payment for work - this creates an employer/ employee relationship and as a result PAYE must be deducted

b. a payment for the use of marae premises involving accommodation, food, drink and/or other services - this is strictly a business arrangement. (In cases where a marae is registered for GST, then such tax is payable by the Trust in addition to the charge levied by the marae and is subsequently accounted for by the marae as GST input tax.)

c. any other payment that does not meet the IRD definition of an unconditional gift set out under section 3 of this policy.

Payments of the types described under section 8 of this policy must not be described as koha, and must be charged to the appropriate expenditure transaction code (advice on coding should be sought from the Treasurer).

# requests for donations or koha

A request for funds for a donation or koha must be made in advance of the donation or koha being given; claims for reimbursement after a donation or koha has been made will not be approved under any circumstances.

Requests for funds for a donation or koha must be submitted to the Treasurer on a [Koha, Gift, Sponsorship Form](link to form goes here) which: a. sets out the rationale for the donation or koha (under 'description'), b. stipulates the account to be charged (transaction type ####), and c. has been properly authorised by the relevant budget holder.

Any donation or koha of more than $400 is subject to the approval of the Chair.

Koha to be given by different working groups within the Trust to the same recipient must be treated as one transaction and must follow the process set out under section 12 of this policy if the total exceeds $400.

# provision of donations or koha

Donations and koha are issued by the Trust in the form of a cheque; under no circumstances may a Credit Card be used for donations or koha.

The Trust will not provide donations or koha in cash under any circumstances. A receipt must be obtained from the recipient of the donation or koha wherever possible; it is appropriate to present koha to marae in cheque form, and it is appropriate to request a receipt.

# sponsorship

Trust sponsorship of outside organisations and events is subject to consultation with the Trustees, who will ensure that any sponsorship arrangements fit the unique nature of the Trust, and are consistent with its vision, strategic objectives and role as a charitable trust.

Community or staff member(s) must obtain the approval of the {appropriate role here} and forward details of any proposed sponsorship to the {appropriate role here} for consideration, before agreeing to any arrangement with an external organisation.

Costs of sponsorship arrangements are subject to the approval of the {Trustees}.

All sponsorship expenditure is to be clearly identified as such, and must be charged to transaction type ####.

# responsibility for monitoring compliance

The Treasurer is responsible for conducting regular reviews and reporting to the Chair with respect to koha and donation transactions to assess the appropriateness of the systems and criteria set out in this policy; factors to be considered in such reviews include:

- the amount of transactions
- the frequency of transactions
- the recipients
- the extent of coordination within the Trust (e.g., where more than one koha or donation is given in respect of the same event or activity).

The Treasurer is responsible for monitoring compliance with this policy and reporting any breaches to the Chair.

Breaches of this policy may result in disciplinary action under the Staff Code of Conduct.

# waivers and variations

Only the Chair may waive or vary the provisions of this policy in individual cases.
