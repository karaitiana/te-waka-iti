## whakatakinga | introduction

As a charitable entity, the Trust must ensure that it conducts its business with financial prudence. The Trust must ensure that any **donations** or **koha** gifted to a third party are transparent and subject to appropriate scrutiny. In particular, the donation or koha must relate to an activity or event which 'fits' the profile of the Trust, and is consistent with its vision and strategic objectives, and its image as a charitable trust.

## whakaritenga | application

This policy applies to **all members** of the Trust and Te Waka Iti community.

## aronga| purpose

This policy clarifies the circumstances in which donations and the gifting of koha to third parties is appropriate.

## kaupapa here | policy

1. A donation made to a third party, including the gifting of koha, is appropriate in circumstances where:
  -  there is a clearly identified relationship between the Trust and the recipient of the donation or koha, and
  -  the activity or event 'fits' the profile of the Trust, is non-political, is made to a recognised organisation by normal commercial means, not to an individual and, other than in the case of koha, not in cash, and
  -  it can be clearly demonstrated that the donation or gift satisfied the compliance obligations of this policy and either:
    -  in the case of koha, is justified in cultural terms, or
    -  in the case of a donation, is justified in terms of its alignment with the Trust's vision and strategic goals.

2. Personal relationships and obligations of members as private individuals do not of themselves establish relationships or obligations of the Trust.

3. All donations and gifts of koha must conform with regulations issued by the Inland Revenue Department. No payment must be made as a donation or koha (tax free) when the actual circumstances surrounding the payment carry an obligation to pay tax.

**Note:** For example, payments for services such as speaking or cultural performances are subject to resident withholding tax

4. The giving of a donation or koha must have prior approval as follows:
  -  Under $100 in value: on a one over one basis
  -  Between $100 and $500 in value: by the Treasurer
  -  In the exceptional case that the proposed donation or koha is over $500 in value: by the Chair or delegate on the recommendation of a Trustee.

5. The amount of the donation or koha must be appropriate to the circumstances and have regard to Māori custom (in the case of koha)

**Note:** Advice may be sought from the {appropriate role} or delegate on what is appropriate for particular circumstances. This is advice on amount, not a request for approval.

6. Donations and koha must be within the amount budgeted by the Approving manager

7. All donations and koha over $100 must be recorded as a gift given on the Gift Register

8. Where the Treasurer, upon inquiry, ascertains that a donation or koha is actually a payment in relation to services supplied, then a tax invoice must be obtained and the transaction treated in accordance with normal Trust practice for such payments

9. In the rare circumstances of the Trust giving koha or donation to a member the payment will be subject to PAYE under taxation law. The payment must be made through Payroll Services to ensure correct tax treatment of the payment

## ngā tautuhi | definitions

The following definitions apply to this document:

**koha** is an unconditional gift where the recipient has neither stipulated that it be given, nor has an expectation of receiving it. It is distinct from expenditure for services supplied. The giving of koha is an integral part of Māori culture

**Members** means those persons who make up the Trust as set out in section #(#) of {Trust document} and includes Trustees, community members, employees, contractors, sub-contractors and invitees.

**PAYE** is Pay As You Earn which is a form of tax that is deducted from income earned by employees Trust means the Trust of Auckland including all subsidiaries

**Note:** No cash advances for koha should be made by way of the Trust Credit Card.
